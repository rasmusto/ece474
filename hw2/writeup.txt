1. The total area used by the alu is 1664.132701.

2. There were 13 different types of gates used by my design:
AND2X1                    saed90nm_typ
AO221X1                   saed90nm_typ
INVX0                     saed90nm_typ
MUX21X1                   saed90nm_typ
MUX41X1                   saed90nm_typ
NAND2X0                   saed90nm_typ
NAND3X0                   saed90nm_typ
NOR2X0                    saed90nm_typ
OAI21X1                   saed90nm_typ
OR4X1                     saed90nm_typ
XNOR2X1                   saed90nm_typ
XOR2X1                    saed90nm_typ
alu_DW01_addsub_0
    FADDX1                saed90nm_typ
    XOR2X1                saed90nm_typ

3. The number of cells used in the design is 120.
The number of gates is 1664.132701 / 5.5296 = 300.9 ~= 301.

4. The hierarchical block introduced to my design was the module alu_DW01_addsub_0.  This is most likely the ripple adder introduced when I compiled my design with the statement "in_a + in_b".  It is implemented as a chain of full adders.

5. The maximum delay path is 2.53 ps. The beginning point was input external delay and the endpoint was data arrival time.
