ECE 474 Homework 4
TAS design 

Background
In this lab we will take the TAS design we designed in class 
and design the data paths as well as the state machines for 
controlling them.  

The Assignment
I will give you a a top level block diagram of TAS.  What you need 
to do is to fill in the blocks with the appropriate logic.  This 
first requires a complete logic design if yours is not complete. 

We took the time to design the logic "on-the-fly" so the data 
paths and state machines should be pretty well in your minds. 

Work to do:
  1) Finish designing any other parts of the design. Then code the 
     modules.  Note: "coding" is not the same as "designing"!

  2) See that you obtain correct operation. Using your list file output
     and the golden_results file prove correct operation.  A set of .do 
     files (dofiles.tar) are provided to check your work. 

   The compiling, running, simulation and comparison should be orcestrated 
   by a doit script as before. There is no synthesis or testbench for this 
   assignment. 

   Your code must run under my shell script and against my golden_results
   file for full credit.

   You will need a directory "vectors" for the list filet to write your
   results to.  Make that in your doit script.

What to turn in:
    -Submit state machine diagrams for all your state machines as scanned
     .pdf files in your hw4 directory. Put all your verilog code in a rtl_src
      directory.  Submit your entire hw4 directory by tarfile to the TEACH website.
    

 Grading
   -correct operation with correct answers   %80
   -correct state machine diagrams           %20
